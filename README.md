# UandI - GGs Entry to the SYNCS Hackathon

Hi! We've made this repo public so that people can view the source code to our SYNCS hackathon submission! The original repos have been kept private as there were API keys in them that were not suitable for release. 

UandI was a dating and text message anonymisation service developed by Alana Hua, Rebecca Gouveia Pereira, Nicholas Lukman, David Singleton and Cheryl Nie. Our devpost submission is available [here](https://devpost.com/software/uandi-dating-for-the-isolation-generation)

Thank you to every member of the team that made this possible! This was a super exciting project to work on. I (David) was responsible for developing the text message anonymisation service which can be fond in the uandi-form-service folder. Nicholas was instrumental in working with DynamoDB to develop the uandi-form-service. Alana was responsible for developing the frontend of the service, creating a react codebase that allowed users to create profiles and view their current matches. Cheryl Nie and Rebecca Gouveia Pereira were our business analysts who conducted our market research formulated our pitch, designed our revenue model and put together our slide deck which earned us an honourable mention in the 40+ participants at the hackathon.

## What's wrong with online dating?

You’ve heard of USYD, UNSW and UTS Love Letters right? For decades the meta has been unchanged, but on Thursday a UNSW student posted a gamechanger!! One post was requesting google form submissions from potential love interests, rather than browsing for heart reacts. But why didn’t our UNSW poster use existing dating apps, like Tinder, Bumble and eHarmony?

The reality is online dating isn’t all sunshine and roses. A study from 2017 shows that 55% of online daters have experienced some sort of threat during their online dating experience, like uncomfortable or misleading dates and even online stalking. Dating apps are forcing us to give too much information to the wrong people before we even get to know them.

## Meet UandI - the profile that you share how you like

UandI puts you in control of your dating experience. Users create profiles to ask their prospective dates questions, and share them where they choose. Their secret admirers enter answers and their phone number, and if the admired likes their answers, they have 30 texts to get to know each other over a completely anonymised number. The users have total control of their information, and share it on their schedule. With a completely serverless backend, our system can scale from 1 to 1000 users easily.

## Why use UandI?

The benefits of our platform are threefold.  User anonymity facilitates superior privacy and security; the use of texting is familiar and convenient, reducing consumer frictions; and our uniquely open network means that no app download is necessary and profiles can be shared with communities of the users’ choosing.

## What's next for UandI - Dating for the Isolation Generation

UandI is brimming with untapped potential. In the future, our priorities would be to improve authentication and our site’s anti-abuse functionality - involving ML and sentiment analysis. Then once our platform has been on the market for 18 months, we would seek to build in new features, and optimise our revenue model.
